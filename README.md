## Mega Rocket GYM

Our first project is about a gym website for the coaches to arrange the classes and schedules, for the admins to help the coaches, for the superadmin to mantain the order and the members to pick a class.

## Week 01

We made a screenflow on figma about a GYM called 'Mega Rocket SA'
It has to have a responsive landing page, I particularly work on the mobile design.

## Week 02

I worked in the structure of the html part, git and readme.
Without CSS the page is not cute so i wont share the link.

## Week 03

From the figma project, after developing the code in html, this week I worked on the design with css. The desing should be for a desktop device, it shouldn't be responsive.
